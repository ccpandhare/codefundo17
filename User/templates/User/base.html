            This webapp is made for those who have a brilliant idea in their minds but lack the resources to turn them into a reality.
            The users can search the databse for "Developers", organisations as well as individuals willing to play their role in the development of
            the nation. The users can straightaway get the contact details of the developers and can contact them on their own, presenting their ideas.
            The webapp also provides an oppurtunity for developers to register and enter their 'Tags': i.e. their specializations. This webapp is under development
            as of now and the next step involves the developers to keep a track on which resources are being demanded the most by users. Knowing the same,
            they can contact the users by their own and collaborate with them for the betterment of the nation.
